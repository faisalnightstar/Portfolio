        <span class="purple">Front-end Developer</span>. I am a passionate
        developer who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to
        learn. My goal in life is to be the best at whatever I do, whether it's
        coding or anything else. I'm constantly striving to improve myself as
        much as possible. I believe that if you want something done right then
        you have to do it yourself. That's what I've been doing for years now
        and I think that's why I am so passionate about the things I love to do,
        whether it be coding or anything else. So yeah, that's my intro. Thanks
        for watching. */
